CKLD-1#1 Warning
Clock Net has non-BUF driver and too many loads  
Clock net system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/FCLK_CLK0 is not driven by a Clock Buffer and has more than 512 loads. Driver(s): system_i/processing_system7_0/inst/PS7_i/FCLKCLK[0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.246 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.b_channel_0/bid_fifo_0/cnt_read_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.b_channel_0/bresp_cnt_reg[5]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.246 ns between system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.b_channel_0/bid_fifo_0/cnt_read_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and system_i/ps7_0_axi_periph/s00_couplers/auto_pc/inst/gen_axilite.gen_b2s_conv.axilite_b2s/WR.b_channel_0/bresp_cnt_reg[6]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
